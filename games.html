        <p>This isn't to be confused with the cartridge games. This is the brand name for the games that I, Krypton Cartridge, create. All of these are made from python, and I am grateful for my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, BOOTSTRAP, SQUIRRELPY, ENGLISH, and RUSSIANESE.</p>

    <p>Game 1: A Drip of Venom</p>
    <p>This game is the longest game I have ever made as of 2022. I have just recently finished it with my friend Olivius Death Note Hampshire, and I want to share it with you.</p>
    <p>I am code naming everyone who has worked with me, even myself, but there are some secrets that you might find if you notice. Here are the details of the game that I made:</p>
    <p>It was a long day, but before you got to sleep you checked your computer. However, as soon as you turned on your brand new expensive AI</p>
    <p>computer, a horrific and terrific at the same time adventure began, with poisonous snakes trying to hack and kill you. Can you survive</p>
    <p>and defeat the King Snake? Can you lock all endings including the victor ending? Play A Drip of Venom to find out!</p>
